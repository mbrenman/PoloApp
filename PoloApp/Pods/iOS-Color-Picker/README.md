# iOS Color Picker

A reusable color picker component for iOS. Works for iPhone, iPad, in modal sheets, popovers... just about anywhere.

# Using iOS-Color-Picker

## Installation

The easiest way to use iOS-Color-Picker is with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). Add the following line to your `Podfile`.

```
pod 'iOS-Color-Picker'
```

## Using a Color Picker from a View Controller

Suppose you have a view controller with a `color` property you'd like to let the user pick. 
Make your view controller implement the `FCColorPickerViewControllerDelegate` protocol. Handle the color picked and the cancelled methods, and make a method that triggers showing the view controller.

```
-(IBAction)chooseColor:(id)sender {
    FCColorPickerViewController *colorPicker = [FCColorPickerViewController colorPicker];
    colorPicker.color = self.color;
    colorPicker.delegate = self;
    
    [colorPicker setModalPresentationStyle:UIModalPresentationFormSheet];
    [self presentViewController:colorPicker animated:YES completion:nil];
}

#pragma mark - FCColorPickerViewControllerDelegate Methods

-(void)colorPickerViewController:(FCColorPickerViewController *)colorPicker didSelectColor:(UIColor *)color {
    self.color = color;
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
}

-(void)colorPickerViewControllerDidCancel:(FCColorPickerViewController *)colorPicker {
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
}
```
